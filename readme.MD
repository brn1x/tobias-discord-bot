## Tobias is a simple bot for Discord who can play your song!

To play the songs you only need to use the prefix, which is <mark>%</mark> and them the song name, like down below

```
%play YOUR SONG NAME 
```
```
%play youtube link
```

## Test it by yourself

To run the aplication, you'll need only `NodeJS`, `Yarn` and `Python` installed.  

**OBS:** Python is need because we are using `Distube` which needs it to run.

Clone the repo run `yarn` and then create and `.env` file on the source of the project and create a variable called `DISCORD_USER_TOKEN` and give your Discord bot as its value, like this.
```
DISCORD_USER_TOKEN=YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
```
And finally run with `yarn start`.
